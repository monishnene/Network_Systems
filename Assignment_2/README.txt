I have created 2 extra files for ease of coding. 

server_support.c	server_support.h

I have makefile in both folder which link these files during compilation.

tcp_server.c has the main function.

Use 'make' command in each folder to compile the code.

I have done Get as well as both extra credits.

I have used fork()

I have done pipelining. 

Timeout = 10 seconds

I have done POST.
