I have created 2 extra files for ease of coding. 

proxy_support.c	proxy_support.h

I have makefile in the folder which link these files during compilation.

proxy.c has the main function.

Use 'make' command in each folder to compile the code.

./proxy.elf <port> <cache timeout>

I have done all the required tasks.

Blacklist file contains forbidden hostnames

Hostname_IP file contains stored IP addresses.

Cache folder has the stored cache files.
