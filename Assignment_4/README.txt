I have created 4 extra files for ease of coding. 

DFS_support.c	DFS_support.h
DFC_support.c	DFC_support.h

I have makefile in the folder which link these files during compilation.

DFC.c  and DFS.c has the main functions.

Use 'make' command in each folder to compile the code.

Use "make run" command to start all 4 seervers

use ".\dfc.elf <conf_file> <subfolder>" 

I have done all the required tasks.

I have done traffic control extra credit.

I have done md5sum using system call.

I have done listing using ls system call.

I am using hashtable to show proper ls results.

Commands

GET foo2 
PUT foo2
MKDIR folder_name
LIST
